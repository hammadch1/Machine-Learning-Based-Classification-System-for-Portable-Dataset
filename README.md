# Machine-Learning-Based-Classification-System-for-Portable-Dataset

Introduction:
- Classification system
- Datasets can be from Matlab examples(csv)
- Classifications Algorithms available:
  (a) Naive Bayes Classifier (b) k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) (c) Decision Tree
- Tkinter Based GUI Menu System which allows:
  - Loading the saved samples of dataset in csv format                    (Button: Load Dataset)
  - Selecting the classification algorithm (classifier) to be used        (Radio Buttons: For Classifier Choosing and Button: Submit Your Choice)
    - Setting parameters of chosen classifier                             (Checkbox for m-estimate, and Input box(Entry) for value of k)
    - Show Input Boxes for entering unseen data sample to classify        (Input boxes(Entry) for n number of features)
  - Showing classification results                                        (Button: Show Classification)
